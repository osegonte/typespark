MANUAL STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS

If you're having issues with the automatic run.sh script, follow these steps:

1. Start the backend:
   Open a terminal window and run:
   
   cd backend
   
   # If you have a virtual environment:
   source venv/bin/activate  # or appropriate command for your system
   
   # Start the backend on port 5002
   python app.py --port=5002
   
2. Start the frontend:
   Open another terminal window and run:
   
   cd frontend
   npm start
   
3. Access the application:
   - Backend API should be available at http://localhost:5002
   - Frontend should be available at http://localhost:3000
   
If you need to debug connection issues:
- Check browser console (F12) for frontend errors
- Check backend terminal for any error messages
- The ConnectionTester component will help diagnose issues
